       "  \"This update is awful for emulators. What happened to resolution selection? without being able to pick native it's like playing in a ugly fuzzy mess. and go back to the eyeball button, this limiting movement from only far left side is irritating. and while you're at it, fix that ranged attacks you can't see damage being done. How can you put out something this sloppy as an update. But you'll still want the money for them Gacha's though, huh?\",\n",
       "  'Interesting MMORPG that has a lot of depth and systems. Documentation is not as clear as it should be but tons of friendly players and resources online to help you. One negative is gacha aspect of certain equipment but able to play and advance without need of gacha equipment.',\n",

       "  \"The ragnarok experience, in a phone format. When you love the series, it's hard not to enjoy each iteration, and this version fits that scenario. It's a wonderful game series, and those familiar will be familiar with it's nuances and quirks; those are here too.\",\n",
