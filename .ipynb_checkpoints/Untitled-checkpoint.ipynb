      "'You can now continuously translate someone speaking a different language in near real-time with the Translate app. For example, translate a classroom lecture or a speech. • The Tap-to-Translate floating icon is now movable and easily dismissable. You can also translate copied text by tapping on the notification itself.',\n",
      "comments:\n",
      "[ 'A lot of good stuff, but fails on the most important. You can barely paste any text into this app. Google left a tiny portion of the screen space for pasting text. The space left, if you use the app in horizontal mode, lets you see one and a half line at the time; that\\'s all space left for the text. 75% of the screen remains empty, while the text is pressed up in a corner. That makes the app useless for translating sentences that contains more than just a few words.',\n",
      "'it gets the job done. it can be a bit too formal, though. every language has it\\'s own form of slang and dialects aren\\'t uncommon, and this is with many popular languages, such as Mandarin and Cantonese, English, Spanish, French, Italian Japanese, German and so on. I understand that this is so that as many people can understand you as possible, but being a little lax never hurt anybody. I think once they add regional dialects and more than one or two ways to translate a word it\\'ll be good to go.',\n",
      "'The new version with \"conversation\". I\\'m using this feature every day but now it doesn\\'t translate from Swe to LV. Only from LV to Swe. And that annoying woman\\'s voice every time when the button is pressed, with no chance to turn it off (at least I didn\\'t find it). It was so simple to use the conversation button but now it\\'s made so complicated. I notice later that there is the gray microphone icon, but then I have to delete the previous translation and press it again.',\n",
      "'The translation is kinda messy but overall its good i dont understand why people are giving 1 star. I know there are some reasons why they gave 1 start but give a little hope for the person who made this app. I gave 4 stars so the person who made this app will do a better update than now. For the person who made this app, if you read this, do your best cause ill support this app and the person to do the best you can. Do your best and you\\'ll succeed.',\n",
      "'This has made life very easy when working with people who speak no English and I do not speak their language. Whilst translation isn\\'t always perfect, it is always good enough to enable conversation and to help make complex points understood. Hugely impressed with capability and speed.' ],\n",
