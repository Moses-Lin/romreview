       "  \"A lot to take in if you haven't experienced this game before. Some silly Engrish at times but overall has been fun so far. One account supports multiple characters and you absolutely need to raise multiple ones if you want to progress at a certain point. It's a grind fest, but it's overall f2p to enjoy the base game and progress a main account with help of alts.\",\n",
       "  'Interesting MMORPG that has a lot of depth and systems. Documentation is not as clear as it should be but tons of friendly players and resources online to help you. One negative is gacha aspect of certain equipment but able to play and advance without need of gacha equipment.',\n",

       "  \"This update is awful for emulators. What happened to resolution selection? without being able to pick native it's like playing in a ugly fuzzy mess. and go back to the eyeball button, this limiting movement from only far left side is irritating. and while you're at it, fix that ranged attacks you can't see damage being done. How can you put out something this sloppy as an update. But you'll still want the money for them Gacha's though, huh?\",\n",
       "  'decent modernization while keeping the old feel. still a mobile game so expect pay to win. wish it was better optimized too. Events are very haphazard and need clarity',\n",
       "  \"doesn't work well at all. on screen controls don't work, it let's me move but i can't interact with anything. can't access settings can't do anything really except walk around. disappointing to say the least. seems like it's optimized for potatoes\",\n",

There's no support whatsoever, unlike the versions of this game from other areas in the world, and to make it worst, most paid services and items are more expensive here than in those other versions, which further supports the notion that these devs just don't care and are interested in milking it for money.\",\n",

If you wish, you can spend a little $$ to get small bonus upgrades. But its nothing significant unless you spend thousands which would be stupid in my opinion.\",\n",
       "  'An epic remake! I just wish it was less of a cash grab in some cases, but the gotcha mechanics are much more rewarding than games like Eternal Sword or Tales of Wind. Great fixes, so much more balanced than the old Ragnarok Online, and a lot more to do!',\n",
