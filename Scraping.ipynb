       "  'Interesting MMORPG that has a lot of depth and systems. Documentation is not as clear as it should be but tons of friendly players and resources online to help you. One negative is gacha aspect of certain equipment but able to play and advance without need of gacha equipment.',\n",

       "  \"This update is awful for emulators. What happened to resolution selection? without being able to pick native it's like playing in a ugly fuzzy mess. and go back to the eyeball button, this limiting movement from only far left side is irritating. and while you're at it, fix that ranged attacks you can't see damage being done. How can you put out something this sloppy as an update. But you'll still want the money for them Gacha's though, huh?\",\n",
       "  \"Been playing online games since the 90's and this is a solid game, you buy your equipement with the currency in-game and up your skills also with the same. If you wish, you can spend a little $$ to get small bonus upgrades. But its nothing significant unless you spend thousands which would be stupid in my opinion.\",\n",
